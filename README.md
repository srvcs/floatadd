# srvcs-floatadd

The floating-point addition primitive of the srvcs.cloud distributed standard
library.

Its single concern: **a + b**, evaluated over the reals. Unlike the integer
[`srvcs-add`](https://github.com/srvcs/add), this service accepts **both
integers and floats** and returns an `f64` `result` (which may have a fractional
part). There is no domain restriction.

It does not validate input itself — it delegates "is this a number" to
[`srvcs-isnumber`](https://github.com/srvcs/isnumber) over HTTP, the single
source of truth for that question, once per operand. Each validated operand is
then coerced with `as_f64()` and the sum is computed as `a + b`.

If `srvcs-isnumber` is unreachable, `srvcs-floatadd` reports itself **degraded
(503)** rather than guessing.

## API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Service identity, concern, and dependency list |
| `POST` | `/` | Compute `a + b` (as an `f64`) |
| `GET` | `/healthz` `/readyz` `/metrics` `/openapi.json` | srvcs service standard surface |

```sh
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/ -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"a": 1.5, "b": 2.25}'
# {"a":1.5,"b":2.25,"result":3.75}
```

Responses:

- `200 {"a": a, "b": b, "result": n}` — evaluated; `result` is an `f64`.
- `422` — an operand is not a number (per `srvcs-isnumber`).
- `503` — a dependency is unavailable.

## Dependencies

- [`srvcs-isnumber`](https://github.com/srvcs/isnumber) — input validation.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SRVCS_BIND_ADDR` | `0.0.0.0:8080` | Bind address |
| `SRVCS_ISNUMBER_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8081` | Base URL of `srvcs-isnumber` |
| `SRVCS_ENV` | `development` | Environment label for logs |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info,tower_http=info` | Tracing filter |

## Local checks

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

Orchestration tests stand up a mock `srvcs-isnumber` in-process, so the suite
runs without the rest of the fleet. See
[`srvcs/platform`](https://github.com/srvcs/platform) for the shared standard.
